### Pre-processing
Shotgun metagenomic libraries from sequencing run YYYY were pre-processed using the[nf-core/eager] (https://github.com/nf-core/eager) pipeline with aDNA-trim after [shyama-mama](https://github.com/shyama-mama/eager/tree/v2.4.5-sharding) 
### Initial metagenomic screening
The aDNA-trimmed libraries were parsed through [krakenUniq](https://github.com/fbreitwieser/krakenuniq) metagenomic classifier - see script run_krakenUniq.sh
